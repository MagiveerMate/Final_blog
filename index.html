      I am a hard working, honest individual. I am a good timekeeper, always willing to learn new skills. I am friendly, helpful and polite, have a good sense of humour. I am able to work independently in busy environments and also within a team setting. When i was in grade five we had to make a speech about what we wanted to do as a living. I decided to choose game creation. Little did i know i was already on my way to becoming a developer who is eager to learn and keep growing not only as a person but as a developer as well.
